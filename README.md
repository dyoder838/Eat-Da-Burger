## Description
This is a simple burger logger made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 

This project was created to practice the above packages and the coding concepts required within them. 

A user can type in a burger name and select wether or not they have eaten it before, push the create button and the burger will populate in a list denoting wether or not it has been eaten. 
The user can also elect to eat an uneaten burger, or delete a burger all together.

All saved information is stored in an SQL database.
